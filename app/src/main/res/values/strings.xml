    <string name="intro">Language</string>
    <string name="title_page_zero">Once upon a time there was a cow.</string>
    <string name="title_page_one">The cow lived on an small planet, called Configura.</string>
    <string name="title_page_two">In the house lived Hildas friend Squilda. </string>
    <string name="title_page_three"> The milk gave Squilda all the food she needed, for Hilda was a quite magical cow and her milk was very powerfully potent. </string>
    <string name="title_page_four">They were good friends and would often sit up in the evenings, looking at the stars and talking.   </string>
    <string name="title_page_five">Then one night, after they had both gone to sleep, a sound woke them. </string>
    <string name="title_page_six">The sound was coming from above! And there seemed to be a crack of light up above, like the sky was ice that someone heavy was standing on. </string>
    <string name="title_page_six_point_five">The two friends wondered what kind of creatures might be on the other side of the crack,
maybe they had squirly legs or maybe they could fly around and live on the clouds?</string>
    <string name="title_page_seven">They used the powers of Hildas milk to run the rocket, and built its body of leaves from the bush, bound together with branches from the tree. For the top of the rocket they used the roof of their house. </string>
    <string name="title_page_eight">They spoke the magic words to the milk and the rocket took off! Up, up, up, up and away! </string>
    <string name="title_page_nine"> It was daylight on the other side. They landed upon a grassy hill. </string>
    <string name="title_page_ten"> A creature approached them. He came right up and boffed them on the face, which made them realize he was a friend. </string>
    <string name="title_page_eleven">Valfiskdrake taught them that they could use the balls that were instead of water in the sea to bounce with. He told them he could lead the way to the creature who had made the crack. So they followed him.</string>
    <string name="title_page_twelve">Valfiskdrake explained that the crack had come from an owl-like creature in a lab high in the mountains. </string>
    <string name="title_page_thirteen">Higher and higher they went, until they arrived at a little cottage near the peak of a mountain.</string>
    <string name="title_page_fourteen"> In owls cottage, lightning was going off from a big machine. The machine shook back and forth. </string>
    <string name="title_page_fifteen">When Hilda and Squilda came in, Owl was startled and jumped, but Valfiskdrake came in and boffed him on the face, which calmed him down. </string>
    <string name="title_page_sixteen">I have three machines, said Owl, jumping around the kitchen to show them, and my Mom is gone so I dont know which of them to use to make tea!</string>
    <string name="title_page_seventeen">Squilda knew! She took the littlest machine and came back quick as a flash with hot steaming tea! </string>
    <string name="title_page_eighteen">Owl was such a much happier Owl when he had drunk his tea. He fiddled his ears and jumped with pleasure!</string>
    <string name="title_page_nineteen">It was a music-machine! </string>
    <string name="title_page_twenty">After drinking a lot more tea, and a lot more dancing, the sun began to set. It was time for Hilda and Squilda to go home.</string>
    <string name="title_page_twentyone">It was dark when Hilda and Squilda came back to the ship, and they could see the light of their sky through the crack.</string>
    <string name="title_page_twentytwo">When Owls mom came home, she fixed the hole in the sky, but she left a little crack open, so that the friends could see each other and visit each other from time to time...   </string>

    <string name="text_page_zero">The cows name was Hilda. </string>
    <string name="text_page_one"> The planet of Configura had one tree, one bush and one house.</string>
    <string name="text_page_two">Squilda had 5 tentacles and would milk Hilda every morning.  </string>
    <string name="text_page_three"> </string>
    <string name="text_page_four">They would often wonder what was out there... </string>
    <string name="text_page_five">It was a creaking sound, as if something were about to break.  </string>
    <string name="text_page_six">And then, "Crack!" "Boom" "Swoosh!" the sky broke and there was a big hole!</string>
    <string name="text_page_six_point_five">They decided to build a rocket to find out!</string>
    <string name="text_page_seven"></string>
    <string name="text_page_eight"> </string>
    <string name="text_page_nine"></string>
    <string name="text_page_ten">He told them his name was Valfiskdrake.</string>
    <string name="text_page_eleven"></string>
    <string name="text_page_twelve">So on they went towards Owl, and when they got high enough they got on a cloud, because on this planet the clouds were strong, and people and things were light.</string>

    <string name="text_page_fourteen"></string>
    <string name="text_page_fifteen"></string>
    <string name="text_page_sixteen">Do you know? he asked.</string>
    <string name="text_page_seventeen"></string>
    <string name="text_page_eighteen">They decided to let the sky-breaking machine be, and go find out what the last machine could be?</string>
    <string name="text_page_nineteen"></string>
    <string name="text_page_twenty">They said good bye to their new friends Valfiskdrake and Owl, and started floating back towards their spaceship.</string>
    <string name="text_page_twentyone">The rocket zipped up and in two blinks they were gone through the crack. </string>
